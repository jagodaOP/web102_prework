## Notes

Styling Consistency:

Challenge: Achieving a consistent and visually appealing design across different elements and sections.
Solution: Revised CSS styles for buttons, ensuring a cohesive look and feel. Adjustments were made to font sizes, padding, and colors to maintain visual consistency.
Button Highlight and Click States:

Challenge: Implementing button click and highlight functionality, ensuring buttons change appearance when clicked or hovered.
Solution: Used JavaScript to toggle classes and applied corresponding styles. Ensured that buttons behaved consistently, providing visual feedback to users.

Scroll Animation and Button Click:

Challenge: Implementing smooth scroll animations when clicking on buttons and ensuring the correct button gets highlighted based on the scroll position.
Solution: Utilized JavaScript to handle button clicks, initiate smooth scrolling, and update button styles based on the scroll position. This involved calculating the position of elements on the page.
Code Organization and Readability:

Challenge: Maintaining clean and organized code for better readability and ease of maintenance.
Solution: Grouped related functions together, used meaningful variable and function names, and provided comments where necessary. This enhances code readability and helps future development.
